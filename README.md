# Week 9-14 Project part 1
This period will be mostly project, with sprints and development of the solution for Polygon.

I have added a [file on gitignore](gitignore.md), as many had problems with it.


- [Groups](groups.md)

- [Semester plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zSEZmKhArmABz01OYuT6r_hhprzMmqxqNV_IkqIMocY/edit?pref=2&pli=1#gid=0) Including when there are scrum meetings and reviews, as well as mandatory presence.

There are some topics which will be addressed in the project period. Basically they are best understood when you have a larger system to keep track of.

- Week 10: a few days on how to write automated tests for part of your program
- Week 11: a day on how to handle all the SQL exceptions in a good manner [slides here](Errorhandling.md) and example code in 2 projects: 
    1. ErrorhandlingDemo and
    2. ExceptionDemo
- Week 12: a day on how to refactor your program into a better style
- Week 13: two days where we talk about overall architecture and code documentation

In this repo there is now a demo folder that contains demo projects to show simple examples of how to solve:  
1. testing: testBat  
2. exception handling in java: ExceptionHandling  
3. how to send mail from a java program: SendMail  
4. how to create pdf files from a servlet: CreatePDF  
5.
